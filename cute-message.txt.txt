My dearest Mam Z, you are the sunshine that illuminates every darkness, the calm in every storm, and the safe haven where I can always find peace. I want to take a moment to express my appreciation for never giving up on me, for believing in us even and never giving up on us. Your unwavering support, unconditional love, and unrelenting encouragement make me feel seen, heard, and cherished. You are the most beautiful, wonderful, and incredible Girlfriend ever , and I am so lucky to have you by my side. I love you more than words can express, more than any code or letter can express I write them for you but they are nothing compared to your love for me, I love you to the moon and back. You are the love of my life, and I promise to cherish, honor, and adore you forever. To the moon and back, times infinity, my love for you knows no bounds. I never want to lose you, and I promise to do whatever it takes to make you happy, even if it means creating a million websites and writing a million codes. You are that amazing, and I am forever grateful for your presence in my life.P.S- Lets play Car parking and all the best tomorrow and this week</p>
